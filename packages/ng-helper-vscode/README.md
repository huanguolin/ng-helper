## Requirements

* VS Code 1.80.0+
* TypeScript 3.5.3+ (Some features require this, see above) 

## Installation

1. Install the extension
2. Create an empty `ng-helper.json` file in the `.vscode` directory of your workspace (***This file is a plugin activation flag - the plugin will not start without it***)
3. Reload VS Code window

## Extension Settings

Create an empty `ng-helper.json` file in your workspace's `.vscode` directory. The following configurations are supported:

* `componentStyleFileExt`: The file extension for component styles (e.g., `less`, `sass`). Defaults to `css`.
* `componentScriptFileExt`: Choose between `js` or `ts`. Defaults to `js`.
* `injectionCheckMode`: Dependency injection validation mode. Available options: `strict_equal`, `ignore_case_word_match`, `count_match`, and `off` (from strictest to no validation). Defaults to `count_match`.

## Known Issues

Auto-completion features (such as in HTML templates) may not work if no TypeScript/JavaScript files have been opened after launching the project. This happens because the TypeScript language service hasn't been initialized. When this occurs, a warning message will appear. Click OK to automatically open a TypeScript/JavaScript file, then return to your HTML file where auto-completion should now work properly.
